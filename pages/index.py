Layout in Bootstrap is controlled using the grid system. The Bootstrap grid has 
twelve columns.

There are three main layout components in dash-bootstrap-components: Container, 
Row, and Col.

The layout of your app should be built as a series of rows of columns.

We set md=4 indicating that on a 'medium' sized or larger screen each column 
should take up a third of the width. Since we don't specify behaviour on 
smaller size screens Bootstrap will allow the rows to wrap so as not to squash 
the content.

            ## Predicting Movie Revenue

            Using machine learning, you can predict the revenue a movie based on budget, genre, and year.
            
            This may be useful for a variety of reasons such as movie producers who want to come up with a new idea for a movie that will create a large amount of revenue. It could also be useful for those interested in the profit a future movie that has been announced might make.
